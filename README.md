# ARRAYS-and-STRINGS
Experiment 7

## AIM
To study use of and to implement arrays and strings in C++.

## Theory
### Arrays in C++
An array is a data structure of elements with same data type stored at contiguous memory locations.

## Features :
1. Fixed size: The size of an array after being defined cannot be changed later.
2. Contiguous memory allocation: All elements are stored in continuous memory blocks.
3. Index-based: Array elements can be accessed using thier indices.

   ### Strings in C++
Strings are sequences of characters used to store text. In C++, the string class is defined in the <string> header file. There are two types of strings in C++ :

C style Strings
std : : string

## Features:

1. Iteration: Strings support iterations for traversing thier contents.
2. Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the + operator.
3. Indexing: Strings support indexing, allowing access to individual characters using the [] operator.
4. Comparison: Strings can be compared using operators (==, !=, <, >, etc.).
5. Modification: Characters in a string can be modified through direct indexing.

## Algorithms

Checking Palindrome

Input the String:

Ask the user to enter a string.

Initialize Variables:

Store the input string in a variable, a.

Initialize an empty string, revstr.

Determine the Length:

Calculate the length of a and store it in length.

Reverse the String:

Loop from the end of the string to the beginning:

Append each character to revstr.

Compare the Strings:

Compare the original string a with the reversed revstr.

If a == revstr, the string is a palindrome.

Else not a palindrome.

Output the Result:

Print whether the string is a palindrome or not based on the comparison.

Printing Array Elements

Initialize the Array:

Define an array x as {19, 10, 8, 6, 8}.

Loop Through Array:

Use for loop in the array.

Print Each Element:

print each element of the array using the loop.

End Program:

Search in an Array

Initialize Variables:

Define a variable key to store the user's input.

Define an integer i for loop iteration.

Define an array x with 5 elements {34, 56, 78, 90, 20}.

Input the Key:

Ask the user to enter a number and store it in key.

Search for the Key:

Use for loop over the array x.

check x[i] with key in the loop.

Check for Match:

If (key == x[i]), print i where the key is found and exit the loop using break.

If Not Found:

After the loop, if no match is found (i == 5), print "Number not found".

End Program:
